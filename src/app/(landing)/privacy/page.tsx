          and protect your personal and non-personal information when you use
          our website and platform (collectively, the &quot;Service&quot;).
        </p>

        <p>
          By accessing or using the Service, you agree to the terms of this
          Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with the practices described in
          this policy, please do not use the Service.

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

        <h3>1.1 Personal Data</h3>
        <p>We collect the following personal information from you:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Name:</strong> We collect your name to personalize your
            experience and communicate with you effectively.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Email:</strong> We collect your email address to send you
            important information regarding your account, service updates, and
            communication.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Payment Information:</strong> We collect payment details to
            process your subscription payments securely. However, we do not
            store your full payment information on our servers. Payments are
            processed by trusted third-party payment processors (Stripe). For
            more information, please review the{" "}

            .
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Account Information:</strong> We collect information related
            to your account, including organization details, agent
            configurations, and workflow settings.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Call Data:</strong> When you use our AI Voice Agents
            service, we may collect and store call recordings, transcripts, and
            related metadata in order to provide and enhance our services. We
            retain call recordings and transcripts for a limited number of days
            determined by your plan, after which they are promptly deleted. We
            maintain strict internal policies for handling any personal
            identifiable information (PII) that may appear in transcripts and
            call data, and we regularly clear and audit stored content to ensure
            your privacy. Additionally, our platform has built-in guardrails to
            prevent agents from requesting PII—such as credit card numbers or
            social security numbers—unless you have explicitly configured your
            agent to do so.
          </li>
        </ul>

          We may use web cookies and similar technologies to collect
          non-personal information such as your IP address, browser type, device
          information, and browsing patterns. This information helps us to
          enhance your browsing experience, analyze trends, and improve our
          services.
        </p>

          not be liable for any loss, damage, or harm resulting from any
